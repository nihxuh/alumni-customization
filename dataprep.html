<h3>Alumni Census Project</h3>
<p>In 2015 WSU’s Graduate School launched an Alumni Census Project in which the current employment information of 866/950 (91%) biomedical doctoral alumni who graduated from 1999–2014 from biomedically-related programs were collected, as previously described <span class="citation">(Feig et al. 2016)</span>. These programs are Anatomy and Cell Biology; Biochemistry and Molecular Biology; Biological Sciences; Biomedical Engineering; Cancer Biology/Oncology; Chemistry; Communication Sciences and Disorders; Immunology and Microbiology; Medical Physics; Molecular Genetics and Genomics; Nutrition and Food Sciences; Pathology; Pharmaceutical Sciences; Pharmacology; Physiology; Psychiatry and Behavioral Neurosciences; and Psychology. The information gathered included a direct survey of alumni to indicate their current job placement, as well as information gathered directly from graduate programs and graduate faculty. Alumni were also asked to answer a series of questions about their career trajectories, including information on their first placement, the length of time they have been with their current employer as well as their various job titles over time to provide a rich view of their career progression. The complete survey is available in the <a href="javascript:window.open('http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0197473#pone.0197473.s004','_blank')" class="uri">S1 File</a>. Self-reported employment data were validated using alumni institutional websites, federal funding agency and publication records, Google, LinkedIn, and other professional social media sites. Only one alumnus was unemployed at this point in time (0.1%); we have omitted this student from further consideration and report outcomes for the remaining 865 alumni.</p>

<h3>Characteristics of Alumni in Each Tier</h3>
<p>The 865 alumni include 459 women (53%), 406 men (47%); 464 White (54%), 334 Asian (39%), 48 Black (5%), 19 total Native American, Pacific Islander race (2%); 478 U.S. citizens/permanent residents (55%), and 387 non-U.S. citizens (45%), as shown in <a href="javascript:window.open('http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0197473#pone-0197473-t001','_blank')" class="uri">Table 1</a>. We have additionally shown gender, race and citizenship status for each category in <a href="javascript:window.open('http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0197473#pone-0197473-t001','_blank')" class="uri">Table 1</a>. We compared the career choices of alumni based on gender (men and women); race (Asian, Black, White; however we are not reporting the outcomes of alumni that have small numbers to maintain their confidentiality and because statistical power is too low in these groups); and citizenship status (U.S. citizen/permanent resident or non-U.S. citizen).</p>

<h3>Data Reporting and Visualization</h3>
<p>Career outcomes are reported in percentages; numbers from which these percentages are derived are presented in Tables A-X in <a href="javascript:window.open('http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0197473#pone.0197473.s002','_blank')" class="uri">S2 Table</a>. Categories with fewer than 4% alumni are not reported in order to preserve confidentiality because in some groups only 1–2 people may be represented. As we examined our data, we realized that the distributions of alumni in Employment Sectors, Career Types and Job Functions change over time. Since most of these changes were seen in 5-year windows, we have depicted all data in these three 5-year windows to visualize employment shifts; i.e., Window 1 (0–5 years), Window 2 (6–10 years), and Window 3 (11–15 years) immediately following graduation. Note that in this manuscript, the trajectory of each alumnus over a 15-year time period is not reported. Rather, the overall alumni aggregate employment data are shown in each time window from years following graduation within each of the three tiers at the specific time of the survey. So, for example, a student who graduated in 2006 would be represented in the 6–10 year block only. <a href="javascript:window.open('http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0197473#pone-0197473-g001','_blank')" class="uri">Fig 1</a> summarizes all three Tiers for these time windows, and Figs <a href="javascript:window.open('http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0197473#pone-0197473-g002','_blank')" class="uri">2</a>–<a href="javascript:window.open('http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0197473#pone-0197473-g004','_blank')" class="uri">4</a> show each Tier by category. To reiterate, these are aggregate data of all alumni in the time window and not movement of individual alumni over time.</p>

<h3>Statistical Analysis</h3>
<p>Outcome analyses were performed using SPSS version 25 (IBM 2018). Chi-Square analyses with follow-up z tests employing a Bonferroni correction were used to test for significantly different proportions of alumni in different Employment Sectors, Career Types, and Job Functions over time. Since time windows contained different sets of participants, between-subjects analyses were conducted. Multinomial logistic regression analyses were then conducted to test for significant interactions between time windows and demographic characteristics. However, none of these interactions were statistically significant and in some cases (example, Race), singularities in the Hessian matrix due to small sample sizes in some cells prevented valid multinomial analysis. In the absence of significant interaction effects and because of the Hessian matrix violations, Chi-Square analyses were used to test for significantly different proportions of demographic groups within each tier. As with time windows, post hoc z tests with Bonferroni corrections were used to test for significant effects if the omnibus Chi-square test was significant. Differences among comparison groups were considered to be statistically significant at p < .05. Statistical output tables are reported in Tables A-L in <a href="javascript:window.open('http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0197473#pone.0197473.s003','_blank')" class="uri">S3 Table</a>. In addition, we conducted multinomial logistic regression analyses to test for significant interactions between combinations of demographic characteristics (e.g., gender, race, and citizenship). However, singularities in the Hessian matrix due to small sample sizes in some cells prevented valid multinomial analysis. Chi-Square analyses were also attempted to examine patterns of career outcomes in isolated subsets of alumni; however, small and n = 0 cell sizes for some categories resulted in uninterpretable results. Because the patterns of findings appear to be similar for these small groups, we decided to present analyses on each demographic variable (rather than combinations of variables) to yield robust results that could be used as a basis for future investigations. Thus, the analyses presented here focus on patterns of career outcomes within each demographic group for the entire 15-year window.</p>
